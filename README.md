## **AI Lab**

### Introduction
This project applies various machine learning (ML) techniques to classify the **hypoxic** or **normoxic** state of cells using single-cell RNA sequencing (**scRNA-Seq**) data. The dataset includes two cancer cell lines: **HCC1806** and **MCF7**, each sequenced with two distinct technologies: **SmartSeq** and **DropSeq**. These sequencing methods provide high-resolution insights into gene expression at the single-cell level, enabling us to understand how cells respond to hypoxic conditions.

### Project Workflow

The project is divided into several key steps:

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
   - We begin by examining the dataset to uncover patterns, distributions, and potential sources of variability, which helps inform the subsequent steps of analysis.

2. *Unsupervised Learning*
   - Unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify natural groupings or clusters in the data without relying on predefined labels. This phase helps to reveal hidden structures in the dataset.

3. *Supervised Learning*
   - Supervised learning models are trained to classify cells into **hypoxic** or **normoxic** states based on labeled data. Multiple classification techniques are assessed to determine the most effective model for this task.

4. *Model Selection*
   - We compare the performance of various classifiers to identify the best model for distinguishing between hypoxic and normoxic cells.

### Final Objective

In the final phase, the goal is to develop a more **generalizable classifier** that can effectively classify cells across multiple cell lines and/or sequencing techniques. This aspect of the project is part of ongoing research, as creating a robust multi-cell-line or multi-sequencing classifier remains a challenging but valuable task in the field.


# **Statistic Projects**

## **Life Expectancy Analysis**

### Introduction
This project explores global life expectancy trends using statistical analysis in R. The goal is to analyze how various factors (e.g., GDP, education, healthcare) influence life expectancy across countries.

### Project Workflow

The project is divided into several key steps:

1. *Data Exploration*
   - Import and explore the dataset using visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) to understand trends and correlations.

2. *Regression Analysis*
   - Apply multivariate regression to identify factors predicting life expectancy. Other models like logistic or nonparametric regression are used as needed.

3. *Statistical Testing*
   - Perform a statistical test (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to check for significant differences, such as life expectancy between different regions.
