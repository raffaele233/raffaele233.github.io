### Introduction
This project applies various machine learning (ML) techniques to classify the **hypoxic** or **normoxic** state of cells using single-cell RNA sequencing (**scRNA-Seq**) data. The dataset includes two cancer cell lines: HCC1806 and MCF7, each sequenced with two distinct technologies: **SmartSeq** and **DropSeq**. These sequencing methods provide high-resolution insights into gene expression at the single-cell level, enabling us to understand how cells respond to hypoxic conditions.

### Project Workflow
The project is divided into several key steps:

1. *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*
   - We begin by examining the dataset to uncover patterns, distributions, and potential sources of variability, which helps inform the subsequent steps of analysis.

2. *Unsupervised Learning*
   - Unsupervised learning techniques are used to identify natural groupings or clusters in the data without relying on predefined labels. This phase helps to reveal hidden structures in the dataset.

3. *Supervised Learning*
   - Supervised learning models are trained to classify cells into **hypoxic** or **normoxic** states based on labeled data. Multiple classification techniques are assessed to determine the most effective model for this task.

4. *Model Selection*
   - We compare the performance of various classifiers to identify the best model for distinguishing between hypoxic and normoxic cells.

### Final Objective
In the final phase, the goal is to develop a more **generalizable classifier** that can effectively classify cells across multiple cell lines and/or sequencing techniques. This aspect of the project is part of ongoing research, as creating a robust multi-cell-line or multi-sequencing classifier remains a challenging but valuable task in the field.

## - **Life Expectancy Analysis** 
[link to report](file:///Users/raffaelesimbari/Desktop/Analyzing_Life_Expectancy.pdf)

### Introduction
This project explores global life expectancy trends using statistical analysis in R. The goal is to analyze how various factors (e.g., GDP, education, healthcare) influence life expectancy across countries.

### Project Workflow
The project is divided into several key steps:

1. *Data Exploration*
   - Import and explore the dataset using visualizations (e.g., scatter plots, histograms) to understand trends and correlations.

2. *Regression Analysis*
   - Apply multivariate regression to identify factors predicting life expectancy, check normality and analysis of the residuals

3. *Model Selection*
   - Run model selection algorithms to try and obtain a better model (Step-up, Step-Down, Step-Both).

4. *Hypothesis Testing*
   - Perform a statistical test (e.g., t-test, ANOVA) to check for significant differences, such as life expectancy between different regions.

### Final Objective
The primary objective of this project is to identify key drivers of life expectancy and understand how they vary across countries. By applying regression and statistical tests, the project aims to provide insights into the global health landscape.

# **Numerical Methods Project** 

## - **Revisiting Lotka-Volterra: Expanding Predator-Prey Dynamics to Multi-Species Systems** 
[link to code](file:///Users/raffaelesimbari/Desktop/Numerical%20methods/Project/Project.html)

### Introduction
In this project, we extend the classical Lotka-Volterra model by revisiting and adapting it to handle more complex, real-world scenarios involving multiple species. The primary objective is to simulate predator-prey interactions in a multi-species environment, first with two species (a predator and a prey) and then with three species (introducing a third species to interact with both the predator and the prey). This approach allows for a more comprehensive understanding of ecological stability and species coexistence in ecosystems with more intricate food webs.
